### NOTES: ###
When conditionallay attaching classes:

`:class="{'class-to-attach': true | false }"`

- `class-to-attach` is the class to attach or not based on the `true | false` test
- `class-to-attach` must be enclosed within single quotes as it is hyphenated, whereas `classToAttach` would not require the quotes
- the `true | false` test can be anything that is a Boolean - method, property value, etc
- `:class="{'class-to-attach': true | false, 'another-class': true | false }"` as shown, conditionals can be chained for alternative classes
